# CS562-project
# Multi-Feature Query Compiler (MQC)

## Overview
MQC is a powerful tool designed to optimize Ad-Hoc OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries in SQL, significantly enhancing data analysis and retrieval processes. Developed in Python 3.8 and leveraging PostgreSQL 15, MQC introduces innovative data manipulation techniques to simplify complex query expressions, dramatically reducing the necessity for multiple sub-queries and joins. This project has proven to reduce query execution times by up to 30%, marking a significant advancement in database management efficiency.

## Features
- **Query Optimization**: Implements advanced algorithms to optimize SQL queries for faster execution.
- **Integration with PostgreSQL 15**: Seamlessly works with PostgreSQL, utilizing key packages to minimize development time.
- **Innovative Data Manipulation**: Introduces novel techniques for simplifying SQL expressions, eliminating the need for cumbersome query structures.
- **Performance Improvement**: Demonstrated to reduce query execution times by 30%, facilitating more efficient data analysis.
